I get up at 8:15a.m when I have first lesson and at 10:00a.m when I have 2th.
Usually studying and work spend about 9-12 hour everyday. I work on practical
lessons and listen all lectures after this doing homework and learn addition information for self de
veloping in IT direction.
My friends and classmates spend day with me by 
voice chat, sometime it seems a little bad sad  `course isn't IRL communica
tion. As for me the biggest problem is sitting a long time on same place, and that usually a have t
o done a lot of studying tasks by short time. Between work and studying I relax while watching anime or go to 
training. On my opinion the best part of day is time when I sleep, second is a
feeling that tasks were done and third is relax time
